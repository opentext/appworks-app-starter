                    AppWorks JS allows you to work offline by storing user intention while the device is offline and
                    providing you with the ability to reconstruct that intention when the device comes back online.
                    This example will send a request to fetch random user data and display it below.

                    First try sending a request with the device online. Then try putting the device on airplane mode
                    and trying again - nothing should happen. Then turn the device back online and watch as the
                    requests are made automatically.

                    <b>Advanced:</b>
                    Turn the device offline. Then exit the app completely and kill it. Come back online. Open the app
                    back up. Watch as the requests are made.
